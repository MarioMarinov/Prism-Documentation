# Getting Started

From a simple perspective, .NET Multi-Platform App UI (MAUI) is the next evolution of Xamarin.Forms. As a result much of Prism for .NET MAUI is based heavily & in many cases identical to Prism for Xamarin.Forms.

.NET MAUI however represents a shift in paradigms, with the introduction of the SingleProject, an App Builder with Dependency Injection as a built in first class citizen. As a result there are many differences between Prism.Maui and Prism.Forms.
