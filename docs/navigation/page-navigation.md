# Page Navigation

Every Platform is unique and has it's own set of requirements and ways it handles navigation. Page based Navigation is not a concept used by Prism within either WPF or Uno Platform. If you are building an app with either of these platforms you should see the documentation for [Region Navigation](xref:Navigation.Regions.GettingStarted). Otherwise you will want to see the documentation specific to the platform you are building with. As Page based Navigation is not supported globally across all platforms the abstractions are different making the documentation for these areas of your application platform specific.
