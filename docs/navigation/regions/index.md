# Getting Started

As a part of the Prism 9.0 initiative, a lot of focus has been given to unifying the Prism API across all of the supported platforms. As a result the Region Abstractions are no longer platform specific. This greatly simplifies what you must learn as you transition from one platform to another. As an added benefit this means that you can now build applications that share ViewModels across WPF, .NET MAUI and Uno Platform and even port your Xamarin.Forms application code to these other platforms.
